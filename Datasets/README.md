# GHG emissions calculation 
## tailored for Singapore's office buildings

> Data Collection and Preprocessing:
1. Identify and collect relevant datasets for GHG emissions calculations, including:
    - Energy consumption data for typical office buildings in Singapore
    - Transportation data for estimating commuting emissions
    - Water and waste management data
    - Local and international emission factors
2. Gather information on Singapore's building standards and energy efficiency regulations.
3. Collect sample activity data from a diverse set of office buildings for testing and      validation.
4. Preprocess and clean the collected datasets, ensuring consistency and compatibility.
5. Document all data sources, preprocessing steps, and assumptions made.
